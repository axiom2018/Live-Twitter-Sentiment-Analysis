            Clustering

clustering algorithms would be great.

        ''' Also save the individual sets of tweets in session state. The reason for this is because in the algorithm
            to DISPLAY these tweets in a plot while they're of course separated by label, whether they're positive,
            neutral, or negative. The thing is the k means model in sklearn assigns it's OWN labels, and definitely
            won't follow mine. For example, in the below m_labels variable 0 = positive, 1 = neutral, 2 = positive.
            However the scikit learn k means will assign the positive tweets 2 instead. The problem becomes clear, 
            especially when one of the goals is to display color points representing the sentiment of each tweet.
            
            To solve this issue I'll have the original sets of tweets, then based on how k means decided to label each
            of them, separate those new sets. For example, if the positive tweets are labeled 2 by k means, put those in
            a list. Send that list into a function and compare it with all the original sets of tweets and see how many
            match based on each label. For example if the list has 8 tweets that match the original positive set, that's
            8 out of 10, so likely it's a positive set that the k means model labeled 2. But continue to loop through 
            others just to see if there might be a better match. 
            
            This way there will be consistency regarding which group that the k means model assigns to a set of tweets.
            Like the set will be confirmed as positive. '''
